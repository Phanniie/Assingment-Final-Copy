This game was an assignment I was given in Digital Technology
The reuqirements included:
  1. Minimum of 5 rooms
  2. Something to navigate between the rooms
  3. A menu (how to play, exit, help etc)

It is a casual and friendly game cated towards people in highschool (or above). This game also includes mini games in it that ranges from using your knowledge to testing your luck!
